## 🔍 Technical Highlights: Under the Hood

### Backend Overview
The backend of Chronos is a robust Spring Boot application, structured to handle complex task management workflows with ease. You can explore the full backend code in the [BackEnd/](BackEnd/) directory. Key components include:

- **Controllers**: Manage API endpoints for authentication, user management, task operations, and reporting. For example, the `TaskController` handles task creation, updates, and retrieval, while the `AuthController` secures user login with JWT.
- **Services**: Contain the business logic, such as the `NotificationService`, which creates and queues notifications using RabbitMQ for asynchronous delivery, ensuring users receive timely updates without overloading the server.
- **Repositories**: Provide data access using Spring Data JPA, with repositories like `TaskRepository` and `UserRepository` handling database operations for tasks, users, and more.
- **Models**: Define the data structure, such as the `Notification` entity, which stores notification details (e.g., message, user, timestamp) in PostgreSQL.

### Frontend Overview
The frontend of Chronos is a modern React application built with TypeScript and styled with Tailwind CSS, ensuring a responsive and user-friendly experience. You can explore the full frontend code in the [FrontEnd/](FrontEnd/) directory. Key aspects include:

- **Components**: Modular React components like task cards, user dashboards, and forms, designed to display and manage tasks efficiently. These components are styled with Tailwind CSS for a clean, responsive look across devices, using responsive classes (e.g., `sm:`, `md:`, `lg:`) to adapt layouts for mobile and desktop screens.
- **Time Tracking**: A dedicated time tracking feature allows users to start, stop, and log time spent on tasks. This is implemented with a timer component that tracks elapsed time and displays it in the UI, providing a seamless way to monitor productivity.
- **Mobile Optimization**: The app is fully optimized for mobile devices, with touch-friendly interactions (e.g., tap to edit tasks) and responsive layouts that adjust to different screen sizes, ensuring a smooth experience on both desktop and mobile.
- **Services**: API integration with the backend using `fetch` or a library like Axios, enabling the frontend to retrieve and update tasks, notifications, and user data via RESTful endpoints.

### Notification System
- Notifications are created, stored in the database, and queued using RabbitMQ for asynchronous processing.
- Users can fetch their notifications via API, with plans to add WebSocket support for real-time delivery.

### Planned Features
- **Real-Time Updates**: WebSocket integration for instant task notifications and updates—stay in the loop as it happens!
- **Gantt Charts**: Visualize task dependencies with stunning timelines.
- **Backend Time Tracking Persistence**: Add backend support to store time tracking data persistently in the database (currently implemented in the frontend).
- **Unit Testing**: Robust unit and integration tests with Spring Boot Test to ensure Chronos runs smoothly.
- **Docker Support**: Containerized deployment for seamless scalability and consistency.
